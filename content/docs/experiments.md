### An Experiment file

An _experiment_ is what describes the dataset that you want to process and what you want the generated rules to aim for.  Each experiment is described by a `.yaml` or a `.json` file located in the `experimentsDir` of `config.yaml`.  This will look as follows:

{{< highlight yaml >}}
# The title of the report
title: "What would indicate good flow?"

# The category that this report is in
category: "acme"

# The tags associated with the report
tags:
  - test
  - "household sewage"

train:
  # The dataset to used to train the rule discovery process
  dataset:
    # Describe a CSV dataset
    csv:
      # The name of the CSV file
      filename: "fixtures/flow.csv"
      # Whether the CSV file contains a header line
      hasHeader: true
      # What separator the CSV file is using
      separator:  ","
    # The names of the fields to be used
    fields:
      - group
      - district
      - height
      - flow
  # When to run the experiment's train mode (default: !hasRun)
  when: "!hasRunToday || sinceLastRunHours > 2"


test:
  # An optional dataset used to test the rules generated from the train dataset
  dataset:
    # Describe an SQL connection
    sql:
      # The name of the driver to use (mssql, mysql, postgres, sqlite3)
      driverName: "mssql"
      # The details of the data source
      dataSourceName: "Server=127.0.0.1;Port=1433;Database=master;UID=sa,PWD=letmein"
      # An SQL query to run on the data source to create the dataset
      query: "select * from flow"
    # The names of the fields to be used
    fields:
      - group
      - district
      - height
      - flow
  # When to run the experiment's test mode (default: !hasRun)
  when: "!hasRunToday || sinceLastRunMinutes > 20"

# Describe rule generation
ruleGeneration:
  # The fields that can be used in the rules
  fields:
    - group
    - district
    - height
  # Whether arithmetic rules should be generated
  arithmetic: true
  # The maximum number of rules that can be combined together to form
  # another rule
  combinationLength: 3

# Describe aggregators
aggregators:
    # The name of the aggregator
  - name: "goodFlowMCC"
    # The kind of aggregator to use
    # (calc, count, mcc, mean, precision, recall, sum)
    kind: "mcc"
    # The argument to pass to the aggregator function
    arg:  "flow > 60"

# What goals to try to achieve
goals:
  - "goodFlowMCC > 0"

# The order to sort the rules in
sortOrder:
  - aggregator: "goodFlowMCC"
    direction:  "descending"
  - aggregator: "numMatches"
    direction:  "descending"

# User defined rules to try
rules:
  - "height > 10"
  - "height > 10 && height < 20"

### SQL
For more information about `dataSourceName` see the following for each `driverName`:

* `mssql` - MS SQL Server - [README](https://github.com/denisenkom/go-mssqldb/blob/master/README.md).
* `mysql` - MySQL - [README](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name).
* `postgres` - PostgreSQL - [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq#hdr-Connection_String_Parameters).
* `sqlite3` - sqlite3 - This just uses the filename of the database.

<em>For security reasons any user specified for an SQL source should only have read access to the tables/database as the queries can't be checked for safety.</em>

### Aggregators

The aggregators are used to collect data on the records that match against a rule.  There are the following functions:

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `calc(expr)` | Calculate the result of expression using as variables any aggregatorNames used in the expression |
| `count(expr)` | Count the number of records that match a rule and the supplied expression |
| `mcc(expr)` | Calculate the [Matthews correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthews_correlation_coefficient) of a rule to match against the expression passed.  A coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 no better than random prediction and âˆ’1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation. |
| `mean(expr)` | Calculate the mean value for an expression calculated on records that match a rule |
| `precision(expr)` | Calculate the [precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) of a rule to match against the expression passed |
| `recall(expr)` | Calculate the [recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) of a rule to match against the expression passed |
| `sum(expr)` | calculates the sum for an expression calculated on records that match a rule |

### Sort Order

The rules in the report are sorted in the order of the entries for the `sortOrder` field.  The aggregators that can be used are the names specified in the `aggregators` field as well as the following built-in aggregators.

| Aggregator       | Description                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `numMatches`     | The number of records that a rule matches against |
| `percentMatches` | The percent of records in the dataset that a rule matches against |
| `goalsScore`     | How well a rule passes the goals.  The higher the number the better the match |

### When Expressions

The `when` field determines when the experiment is to be run and how often.  It is an expression that supports the following variables:

| Variable              | Description                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `hasRun`              | Whether the experiment has been ever been run |
| `hasRunToday`         | Whether the experiment has been run today |
| `hasRunThisWeek`      | Whether the experiment has been run this week |
| `hasRunThisMonth`     | Whether the experiment has been run this month |
| `hasRunThisYear`      | Whether the experiment has been run this year |
| `sinceLastRunMinutes` | The number of minutes since the experiment was last run |
| `sinceLastRunHours`   | The number of hours since the experiment was last run |
| `isWeekday`           | Whether today is a weekday |

### Expressions

Any expressions used in the experiment file conform to fairly standard Go expressions and can use the following functions:


| Function        | Description                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `in(n, h ...)`  | Return whether `n` is in the rest of the arguments |
| `ni(n, h ...)`  | Return whether `n` is not in the rest of the arguments |
| `max(n ...)`    | Return the biggest number supplied |
| `min(n ...)`    | Return the smallest number supplied |
| `pow(b, e)`     | Raise `b` to power of `e` |
| `roundto(n, p)` | Round `n` to `p` decimal places |
| `sqrt(x)`       | Return the square root of `x` |
