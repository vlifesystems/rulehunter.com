      <description>Rulehunter is configured using a config.yaml file as follows: # The location of the experiment files. experimentsDir: &amp;quot;/usr/local/rulehunter/experiments&amp;quot; # The location of the html files produced. wwwDir: &amp;quot;/var/www/rulehunter&amp;quot; # The location of the build files created while running. buildDir: &amp;quot;/usr/local/rulehunter/build&amp;quot; # The source URL for the code to comply with the requirements of the AGPL. # (default: https://github.com/vlifesystems/rulehunter) sourceUrl: &amp;quot;https://example.com/somecode/rulehunter&amp;quot; # The base URL for the html files produced. This is so that you could for # example base the Rulehunter generated site at &amp;#39;/rulehunter/&amp;#39; on an intranet.</description>

      <description>An Experiment file An experiment is what describes the dataset that you want to process and what you want the generated rules to aim for. Each experiment is described by a .yaml or a .json file located in the experimentsDir of config.yaml. This will look as follows:
# The title of the report title: &amp;quot;Whatwouldindicategoodflow?&amp;quot; # The category that this report is in category: &amp;quot;acme&amp;quot; # The tags associated with the report tags: - test - &amp;quot;fred/ned&amp;quot; # The type of the dataset (csv or sql) dataset: &amp;quot;csv&amp;quot; # Describe the CSV file csv: # The name of the CSV file filename: &amp;quot;fixtures/flow.</description>
